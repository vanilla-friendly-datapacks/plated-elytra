# Plated Elytra

> A Minecraft 1.16.x data pack that adds support for plating elytras with armor to enhance their armor values.

## Installation

Download the latest release from [here][latest] and put the datapack zip file into the `datapacks` folder of your Minecraft world. Download the resourcepack zip file and enable the pack in your client.

The resourcepack is needed to provide custom items for each plated elytra variant as well as for localized item names.

## Crafting

Drop an elytra together with a chestplate of your choice and a slime ball on top of an anvil.

> **Note:** Chainmail and leather chestplates are not supported and this is intentional.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the datapack, run the `zerotask:plated_elytra/uninstall` function and remove the datapack from your world save. Afterwards, run `reload`.

> **Note:** Already crafted items won't get reverted and keep their stats!
